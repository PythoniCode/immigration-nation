### Chapter 1. Leaving Moscow

We’ve made the decision to leave Moscow. My family has had enough. I’ve had enough. We are going to America.
Illegally.
It’s July 19, 2019. We pack all of our belongings, withdraw all of our savings, and board the airplane to Cancun. Officially, we are going to Mexico on an all-inclusive vacation. Unofficially, we are immigrating.
Getting five tickets to Cancun’s cheapest hotel isn’t simple. Many tour agencies in Moscow won’t sell vacation tours to non-Russian people like us. It costs us over a year of savings to even book the trip.
“How lucky are we?” I tell my six year old, “We get to see the ocean and go swimming soon!”
16 years before, I had left Kyrgizia at 19, about to be a father. I left my pregnant wife to provide for my family. That’s when Moscow became my home.
Moscow was the only place where I could find work that paid enough to live modestly and send enough money home. Many Kyrgizian men went to Moscow for work, but we weren’t wanted there.
“Leave, get out of here, you ‘kitayod” - Asian slut - “Get out of our country! Go back to your dirty home.”
I was a dead man walking the day I arrived.
Kyrgizia was part of the Soviet Union, making Russia just as much my home as it was theirs. I even spoke the language, I held the Russian passport..
But I looked Asian.
Still, there was nothing for me or my family back home. In Kyrgizia we had no money, no jobs, and no future for my family. So I endured the abuse in Moscow. I worked fourteen hours a day, doing the “dirty work” no one else would. I cleaned the streets, swept the dirt, drove the cabs, and, on better days, I cooked pizzas.
Three years later, my family joined me in Moscow. Into two small rooms we crammed ten people. There were the five of us, and five strangers with whom we shared a small kitchen and one bathroom.
It was not just a lack of decent living and privacy, or an ongoing job search that made our life in Moscow unbearable, it was the non-stop humiliation that my wife and kids had to live with: disrespect, bullying, and the constant struggle of not being able to do anything about it. The kids got bullied in school and on the streets. They had no friends because they were not “russians.” My work permit “kartochka”(card) needed to be “extended” every month, which meant the constant bribery of local authorities. I worked day and night to support my family of five and it wasn’t enough. For us to live in Moscow, one of the world's richest cities, became nearly impossible...financially and mentally.
We had to leave this hell.

### Chapter 2. Long Way to Tijuana

When we passed border control in Mexico and left the Cancun airport, I felt a huge weight off my shoulders - honestly, I didn’t think we would make it that far. If you look a bit suspicious to the security guards and can’t prove that you are not immigrating, you can be put right back on the plane to Moscow. But we were on our way to our “Cancun vacation!”
The kids loved every minute of staying by the ocean. Moscow's cold weather and landlocked location was behind them, and so were all the memories of bullying from other Russian kids.
Sand, sea, and an abundance of food brought peace and comfort to them, but us -- the parents -- were still being tortured: “What’s next?”
We called a “contact” who helped us to move forward... across Mexico.
He recommended buying three ticket segments -bus, plane, bus
“This way, it would seem less like you are trying to get to Tijuana” he said after collecting most of the money we brought. Giving him most of my savings was a one way road. We couldn’t fail.
When we boarded our last bus -- with shabby seats, smelly air, and cracked, dirty windows -- we didn’t know that it would be the most terrifying ride of our lives. For two days and two nights we barely talked. We just watched, breathing out hot, humid air while trying to calm the whimpering kids. People came on board and left. They were laughing, drinking, selling drugs, some even guns.
We had to pass many checkpoints, trying to blend in with Mexicans. Luckily we look a bit like them. Men at the checkpoints were taking bribes. I would leave $100 in my passport for an officer at the checkpoint and he would quickly pocket it. On the second day, at the last checkpoint, the police went through all of our belongings - they undressed me in front of my family and others and found little money we had left. “Please don’t take it all'' - I begged him - “Please”. He counted our money and looked at my wife and kids and only took $300. I don’t know what would happen if he took all of our money, how would we eat, sleep, survive.. I was grateful.  
Scared but excited to be in Tijuana where our hopes were rebuilt again.

### Chapter 3. USA

I woke up my family before sunrise to be in line at 5 am for the border crossing. After a few weeks in Mexico, a few years in Russia, we were finally close to the country we dreamed about for many years… America!
I was so grateful to be there! 2035 - this was our number in line. I soon learned that the border officials let only 5 groups cross per day. Some simple math - we would have to wait about 135 Days in line.
We don’t have money for 4 - 5 months to live in a hotel I told them.
Searching for cheaper accommodation than a $20 dollar hotel, we were taken to a shelter on the outskirts of the town. My stomach felt ill when I witnessed the quality of the place and the condition of the people who lived there. Many kids, even toddlers, were unattended, and everyone was extremely dirty and looked unhealthy. Most adults seemed to be under some kind of spell - looking in the distance or far away, but not into your eyes. I didn’t know what was wrong with these people, but I knew for sure, we could not stay here - even though the cost was minimal - just three dollars per day. I asked the people who brought us here to take us away from that place.
Two weeks passed and we were still there checking our place in line every day - and still there were more than 4 months until we could get to the front of the line.
I couldn’t stay in a hotel with my family for another 4 months.
We all took walks every day despite the August heat in Mexico. Staying in a small hotel room with young kids is not easy.
One day, on our lucky walk, we overheard some people speaking Russian and I approached them.
It was good to hear familiar language.
What we learned helped us a lot. They told me about a Russian family with young kids like ours who were creative and rented a car to drive, passing a long line to the patrol booth and they never saw them again. They think they left Mexico most likely and crossed over to the US.
I decided to take yet another risk. We took a taxi to a car rental place a bit further from the border because the rental agency near the border didn’t rent to “suspicious people” like us. I told them that I was on a business trip and needed a car for 2 days. The taxi driver vouched for me and I got a car! I picked up my wife and kids from the hotel with all of our belongings and headed directly to the border!
“Asylum Politica!” - we yelled to the border control. But we were immediately surrounded by 20 workers, searched and handcuffed then tied to chairs. They took our shoelaces...and took our belongings.

### Chapter 4. Asylum

I didn’t know how many hours or days I was gazing at empty walls in the border holding room. Men around me looked spent, hopeless.The large room had no windows. There were about 100 of us, different kinds of men, sitting or laying somberly.
The odor was so strong around me that any thought of staying here much longer made me ill.
“Omurbek” - an official looking person called my name and I jumped on my feet. I didn’t know what to think . My only hope was that my family was not sent back to Mexico as I didn't hear from them for a few days. Also I had heard that two Russian families had been deported.
I was asked a few questions with the help of a translator. They wanted to know if I had anyone to support me in the US and why I crossed the US border. I told them my story.
“You are free to go.”
“Free to go?” I could hardly believe these words…
We were reunited and let onto American soil!
Some nice people met us at the border and took us to a shelter in San Diego. Living in downtown San Diego was a massive improvement, the food was great, people were nice. We were not afraid anymore...
For 2 months we stayed there, trying to find what to do next. Our “fake sponsor” refused to take us and we had nowhere to go. We had no home, no money left. But we were free….
To be able to move on beyond living in shelters, we had to find someone in the US who would sponsor us, someone who would share the house with us, and help financially..
Finally I found someone who knows someone who knows someone, and finally a Kyrgyz family who lives in Pennsylvania were willing to help.
In October, 2019, about 3 months after we left Russia, we set up our new life in a new home in Bridgeport, PA! Our house is the smallest raw home on the street with two stories and a small backyard. It has a small kitchen that opens up to a narrow living room, two bedrooms upstairs and one bathroom. All 5 of us live like kings here in America!
We sure do.
